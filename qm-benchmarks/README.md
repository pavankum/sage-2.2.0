# QM Benchmarks on optimized geometries from the Industry benchmark set

Similar to the QM benchmarks conducted in version 2.1.0, we utilized the same scripts (available at this location: https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage/tree/main/inputs-and-results/benchmarks/qc-opt-geo) to evaluate the performance of version 2.2.0 compared to the previous iterations of the Sage force fields.

Sage 2.2.0 exhibits overlapping characteristics with Sage 2.1.0, and it is better than Sage 2.0.0 in terms of metrics such as RMSD/TFD/ddE, indicating improved performance.

It is important to note that the Industry Benchmark set consists of a limited number of Sulfamides geometries. Therefore, we selected additional molecules (as indicated in the main README) from PubChem for evaluation purposes. These additional molecules are not included in the plots presented here.
